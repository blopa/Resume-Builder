# Resume Builder
### Latest version here: [resume-builder.js.org](https://resume-builder.js.org/)

**Gotta find a job!** Alright, let's make a new resume with this awesome template I found on Google, the problem is, this template might not be as awesome next month, or you might need to constantly add your new experience to the document. Gosh. Wouldn't be better to focus on adding new experiences in a raw format and let a automation process handle the layout? I agreed, and that's why Resume Builder is here.

#### You take care of the data and we take care of the template.

> "Imagine you're an employer, and you have two resumes in front of you. One is filled wall-to-wall with text and uses four different fonts. It's also peppered with dozens of bolded, italicized, and underlined words and phrases.
   The second resume also offers a lot of information, but you can quickly scan the document because it makes good use of white space, features clear and consistent section headings, and uses bullets to make important items stand out.
   Which resume would you look at first?"

## About
[Resume Builder](https://blopa.github.io/Legacy-Resume-Builder/v3/en) is a free open-source project that allows anyone to easily maintain and build any kind of resume using Google Spreadsheets. This was develop as a personal project to help a friend who was struggling spending up to an hour to make a custom resumes. **[TRY IT NOW](https://blopa.github.io/Legacy-Resume-Builder/v3/en).**

For the latest version, access [https://resume-builder.js.org](https://resume-builder.js.org).

## Features
- Multiple Resume templates (soon)
- Parse data from Google Spreadsheet URL, .xls file or .json file.
- Support Json format from [github.com/jsonresume/resume-schema](https://github.com/jsonresume/resume-schema/tree/v0.0.12).
- Convert Google Spreadsheet data into [github.com/jsonresume/resume-schema](https://github.com/jsonresume/resume-schema/tree/v0.0.12) format.
- Theme created with [material-ui-theme-editor](https://in-your-saas.github.io/material-ui-theme-editor/), so it's easy for you to customize.

## Online viewer
Create a GitHub repo [like this one](https://github.com/blopa/resume.json) with the name `resume.json` and a file called `resume.json` in a branch called `main` and following the JSON schema from [github.com/jsonresume/resume-schema](https://github.com/jsonresume/resume-schema/tree/v0.0.12) v0.0.12.

Then you can access your resume via https://https://blopa.github.io/Legacy-Resume-Builder/v3/view/TEMPLATE/GITHUB_USER, for example this URL: [https://https://blopa.github.io/Legacy-Resume-Builder/v3/view/default/blopa](https://https://blopa.github.io/Legacy-Resume-Builder/v3/view/default/blopa). You can also append `/lang` to the end of the URL to add a proper translation to your resume, for example [https://https://blopa.github.io/Legacy-Resume-Builder/v3/view/default/blopa/es](https://https://blopa.github.io/Legacy-Resume-Builder/v3/view/default/blopa/es).

## Available Translations
We currently have translations for **English**, **Spanish** and **Brazilian Portuguese**, those are going to be used to translate sections of your resume, like the title "Publications", etc.

Don't like the way a translation key is translated? For example, you might prefer using "Projects" instead of "Publications".

Simply add a custom `__translations__` object to your `resume.json` file with the keys you would like to translate and their new translation, for example:

```json
{
  "__translation__": {
    "publications": "Projects",
    "education": "Study"
  }
}
```

You can also add it to your spreadsheet by creating columns with the value `__translation__`, like:

Would you like to have your language added to Resume Builder? [Create a Pull Request](https://github.com/blopa/Resume-Builder/issues/18).

## Usage
First of all you need to create a Google Spreadsheet following the same rules as [this one](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1wHJ_n_DwT_U4pknZh9e0r2wxhjxmd_Z5G2A4LUFpnLk/copy) (you can make a copy if you like) and populate with your resume information.
