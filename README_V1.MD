# Resume Builder
### Latest version here: [resume-builder.js.org](https://resume-builder.js.org/)

**Gotta find a job!** Alright, let's make a new resume with this awesome template I found on Google, the problem is, this template might not be as awesome next month, or you might need to constantly add your new experience to the document. Gosh. Wouldn't be better to focus on adding new experiences in a raw format and let a automation process handle the layout? I agreed, and that's why Resume Builder is here.

#### You take care of the data and we take care of the template.

> "Imagine you're an employer, and you have two resumes in front of you. One is filled wall-to-wall with text and uses four different fonts. It's also peppered with dozens of bolded, italicized, and underlined words and phrases.
   The second resume also offers a lot of information, but you can quickly scan the document because it makes good use of white space, features clear and consistent section headings, and uses bullets to make important items stand out.
   Which resume would you look at first?"

For the latest version, access [https://resume-builder.js.org](https://resume-builder.js.org).

## Features
- Multiple Resume templates
- Parse data from Google Spreadsheet or .xls file
- 21 different types of "data"

## Usage
First of all you need to create a Google Spreadsheet following the same rules as [this one](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Mrgu6dOTyEBkzHtoSSH2BhRNd8n8tuupVlcQUJhUY-0/copy) (you can make a copy if you like) and populate with your resume information.
- **Full Name:** Your full name
- **Job Title:** Your resume Job Title
- **Summary:** Summary of yourself
- **Website:** Your website URL
- **Languages:** Languages you speak
- **Email:** Your email
- **Phone:** Your phone number
- **GitHub:** Your GitHub profile link
- **City:** City where you're located
- **Country:** Country where you're located
- **Skills:** Your skills
- **Experience:** Job Title for your experience
    - **Company:** Company where you had this experience (must fill the ``data-for`` with the Experience ID)
    - **From:** Date of when you started the experience (must fill the ``data-for`` with the Experience ID)
    - **To:** Date of when you ended the experience (must fill the ``data-for`` with the Experience ID)
    - **Local:** Where you had this experience (must fill the ``data-for`` with the Experience ID)
    - **Item:** List here things you've done (must fill the ``data-for`` with the Experience ID)
- **Education:** Name of the course you've studied
    - **From:** Date of when you started the education (must fill the ``data-for`` with the Education ID)
    - **To:** Date of when you ended the education (must fill the ``data-for`` with the Education ID)
    - **Local:** Where did you studied (must fill the ``data-for`` with the Education ID)
    - **Item:** List here things you've done (must fill the ``data-for`` with the Education ID)

    - **Description:** Description of your Side Project (must fill the ``data-for`` with the Side Project ID)
    - **Url:** URL of your Side Project (must fill the ``data-for`` with the Side Project ID)

So whenever you want a part of the resume to be an sub-item of another item, you should use the ``data-for`` field. Use your creativity.
